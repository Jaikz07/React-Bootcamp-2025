// A Brief insight into some JavaScript Concepts
/*
#Loop
A loop is a programming construct that repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. Common types include for, while, and do...while loops.

Example:
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}

#Function
A function is a reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task. Functions can take inputs (parameters) and return an output.

Example:
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
console.log(add(2, 3)); Output: 5

#DOM Manipulation
DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation involves using JavaScript to interact with and change the structure, content, or style of a webpage.

Example:
document.getElementById('myElement').textContent = 'Hello, World!';

#Conditional Rendering
Conditional rendering is the practice of rendering different UI elements or components based on certain conditions.

Example (React):
function Greeting(props) {
    return props.isLoggedIn ? <h1>Welcome back!</h1> : <h1>Please sign in.</h1>;
}

#Statement
A statement is a single line of code that performs an action. JavaScript statements include declarations, assignments, loops, conditionals, and function calls.

Example:
let x = 10; // Variable declaration and assignment
if (x > 5) {
    console.log('x is greater than 5'); // Conditional statement
}
