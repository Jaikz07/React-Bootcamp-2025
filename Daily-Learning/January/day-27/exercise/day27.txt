# Theory questions and  answers #

1. What is the difference between Math.round(), Math.ceil(), and Math.floor()?

Answer:
Math.round(): takes a value(number) and decides whether to "go up" or "stay down." If the number is halfway or more (like 2.5), it goes up to the next whole number (3). If itâ€™s less than halfway (like 2.4), it stays down (2).

Math.ceil(): This one take a value(number) and always approximate it up to the nearest whole number, no matter what (example: the values(number) 2.1 ~ 3, 3.4 ~ 4).

Math.floor(): This always goes down to the closest whole number, no matter what (even if the number is 2.9, it goes to 2).

2. What will Math.round(2.5) return? Why?

Answer: It will return 3.
Why: Because 2.5 is exactly halfway, and Math.round() always goes up when the number is halfway or more.

3. How does Math.ceil() behave when the number is negative? Provide an example.

Answer: Math.ceil() still goes "up," but when dealing with negative numbers, "up" means closer to zero.
Example: If the number is -2.7, Math.ceil(-2.7) will return -2, because -2 is closer to zero than -3.
