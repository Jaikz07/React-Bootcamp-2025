const scriptingLanguage = 'A scripting language is a programming language designed for integrating and communicating with other programming languages. Scripting languages are typically interpreted rather than compiled, which means they are executed line-by-line by an interpreter at runtime. They are often used for automating repetitive tasks, manipulating data, and managing system resources. Examples of scripting languages include JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and Perl. These languages are known for their ease of use and flexibility, making them popular for web development, data analysis, and rapid prototyping.In essence, scripting languages enable programmers to write code quickly and efficiently to perform specific tasks without the overhead of more complex programming languages. Their simplicity and power lie in their ability to interact seamlessly with other software components and systems, making them indispensable tools in modern software development.';
