Mid-JavaScript Assignment

Instructions:
ï‚·Use const for variable declarations and let only where necessary.
ï‚·Use template strings for all string outputs.
ï‚·Each group contains 6 questions:
ï‚·3 Subjective questions (Explain concepts or predict outputs)
ï‚·3 Coding questions (Write code to solve problems)
ï‚·Submit your solutions in a .js file.


Group 1 â€“ JavaScript Basics & Arrays
Subjective Questions:
1.Explain the difference between let, const, and var with examples.
2.What are primitive data types in JavaScript? List them with examples.
3.Explain the difference between .map() and .forEach() methods.
Coding Questions:
1.Create an array of 10 fruits. Use .map() to return an array of their lengths.

const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "kiwi", "mango"];
// Your code here

2.Use a for...of loop to print all numbers from 1 to 20.
3.Create an array of numbers and use .filter() to return only the even numbers.


Group 2 â€“ Objects & Object Methods
Subjective Questions:
1.What is the this keyword in JavaScript? Explain with an example.
2.Differentiate between dot notation and bracket notation for accessing object properties.
3.What is an object method? Provide an example.
Coding Questions:
1.Create an object person with properties: name, age, gender, and a method greet() that logs a greeting using template strings.

const person = {
Â  // Your code here
};

2.Create an object car with properties: brand, model, year. Add a method getCarInfo() that returns "This car is a [year] [brand] [model]".
3.Add a new property color to the car object using bracket notation.



Group 3 â€“ Functions & Conditional Statements
Subjective Questions:
1.Explain the difference between function declaration and function expression with examples.
2.What is an arrow function, and how does it handle the this keyword differently from a regular function?
3.How do you use a switch statement in JavaScript? Provide an example.
Coding Questions:
1.Write a function isEven() that accepts a number and returns "Even" if it is even and "Odd" if it is odd.

const isEven = (num) => {
 // Your code here
};

2.Create a function gradeCalculator() that accepts a score and returns grades:
ï‚·90 and above: "A"
ï‚·80 to 89: "B"
ï‚·70 to 79: "C"
ï‚·Below 70: "F"
3.Use a switch statement to create a function dayOfWeek() that returns the day of the week based on a number (1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, etc.).




Group 4 â€“ Loops & Error Handling
Subjective Questions:
1.Explain the difference between a for loop and a while loop with examples.
2.What is a try...catch block used for in JavaScript?
3.Describe the use of the finally block in error handling.
Coding Questions:
1.Write a for loop that prints numbers from 100 to 90 in descending order.
2.Create a function findSquare() that accepts a number and uses a try...catch block to catch errors if the input is not a number.

const findSquare = (num) => {
 // Your code here
};

3.Use a while loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.



Group 5 â€“ Math Methods & Import/Export
Subjective Questions:
1.What is the purpose of Math.random() in JavaScript?
2.How do you export and import functions between two JavaScript files?
3.Explain the difference between named exports and default exports.
Coding Questions:
1.Generate a random number between 1 and 100 and log it to the console.
2.Create a module named mathUtils.js and export a function called addNumbers(). Then, import it into another file and use it to add two numbers.
3.Use Math.max() to find the largest number in this array: [23, 45, 67, 89, 12].





Group 6 â€“ Advanced Objects, Functions, and Loops
Subjective Questions:
1.Explain what a method is inside an object and how it differs from a regular function.
2.What is the difference between .for...in and .for...of loops?
3.Explain the concept of closures in JavaScript.
Coding Questions:
1.Create an object student with properties: name, age, scores (an array of numbers). Add a method averageScore()that calculates and returns the average score.
2.Write a function fizzBuzz() that prints numbers from 1 to 20 but replaces multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz".
3.Create an object calculator with methods add(), subtract(), multiply(), and divide() that perform basic arithmetic operations and return the results.
